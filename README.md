# CS-250-software-development-lifecycle
Final project artifacts for CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, including a Sprint Review and Retrospective using Scrum-Agile practices.

## CS 250 Portfolio Reflection

### Interpreting User Needs Through User Stories
I interpret user needs by breaking high-level requirements into clear, actionable user stories that focus on user value. Creating user stories helps translate abstract needs into specific features by defining who the user is, what they need, and why it matters. Acceptance criteria further clarify expectations and ensure that development and testing align with the user’s goals.

### My Approach to Developing Programs
I approach development iteratively, focusing on small, manageable increments rather than attempting to build everything at once. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily check-ins, and retrospectives help me stay organized and adaptable. In my future development work, I plan to continue using user stories, incremental delivery, and continuous feedback to improve quality and reduce rework.

### Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating across roles, and taking shared responsibility for project outcomes. Throughout this course, I learned the importance of asking clarifying questions, documenting decisions, and supporting teammates when priorities change. Strong teamwork and transparency are essential for delivering successful software in an Agile environment.

## Module Eight Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating user stories help with this?
I interpret user needs by breaking them down into clear, actionable user stories that describe what the user wants and why it matters. Creating user stories helps translate abstract requirements into specific functionality by focusing on user value and acceptance criteria. During the SNHU Travel project, user stories allowed the team to align development and testing with user expectations, ensuring features met real needs rather than assumptions.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development incrementally, focusing on delivering small, testable pieces of functionality. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives help maintain flexibility and continuous improvement. In my future work, I plan to continue using Scrum practices to manage changing requirements, encourage collaboration, and reduce rework through frequent feedback.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating across roles, and being accountable for both individual and team success. Agile development emphasizes shared ownership, adaptability, and respect for others’ perspectives. During this course, I learned that proactive communication and willingness to ask questions are essential to supporting team progress and delivering high-quality software.
