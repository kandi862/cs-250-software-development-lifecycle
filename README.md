## CS 250 Portfolio Reflection

### Interpreting User Needs Through User Stories
I interpret user needs by breaking high-level requirements into clear, actionable user stories that focus on user value. Creating user stories helps translate abstract needs into specific features by defining who the user is, what they need, and why it matters. Acceptance criteria further clarify expectations and ensure that development and testing align with the user’s goals.

### My Approach to Developing Programs
I approach development iteratively, focusing on small, manageable increments rather than attempting to build everything at once. Agile processes such as backlog refinement, sprint planning, daily check-ins, and retrospectives help me stay organized and adaptable. In my future development work, I plan to continue using user stories, incremental delivery, and continuous feedback to improve quality and reduce rework.

### Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating across roles, and taking shared responsibility for project outcomes. Throughout this course, I learned the importance of asking clarifying questions, documenting decisions, and supporting teammates when priorities change. Strong teamwork and transparency are essential for delivering successful software in an Agile environment.
